    history:
      "The foundation stone was laid in March 1913, and the final design of George Wittet was sanctioned in 1914. The gateway was built from yellow basalt and reinforced concrete. The structural work was completed in 1919, and the architectural work was completed in 1924. Ironically, when the gateway was completed, the British Raj was already facing challenges from the Indian independence movement. In a twist of historical significance, the last British troops to leave India following independence passed through the Gateway in a ceremonial march on February 28, 1948.",
    architecture:
      "The Gateway of India is an arch made of basalt, 26 metres (85 feet) high. The central dome is 48 feet in diameter and 83 feet above the ground at its highest point. The whole harbour front was realigned in order to come in line with a planned esplanade which would sweep down to the centre of the town. The gateway is built in the Indo-Saracenic style, incorporating elements of 16th-century Gujarat architecture. The central dome is inspired by Islamic architecture, while the arches are based on Roman triumphal arches.",
    significance:
      "The Gateway of India is one of Mumbai's most recognized landmarks and a symbol of the city's colonial past. It has witnessed many significant events in India's history, including the departure of the last British troops from India in 1948.

Later, it came under British control following the defeat of Tipu Sultan in 1799.
